# Confidence-Aware-Curriculum-Learning-Based-Knowledge-Distillation-
This project applies confidence‑aware curriculum learning and knowledge distillation to optimize a TinyML computer vision model. It builds efficient CNNs to classify technical features such as composite‑insulator hydrophobicity, targeting lightweight, real‑time on‑device inference in resource‑constrained environments.
